<h1>Summary</h1>
<div>In this training-series we are going to build a little game called apple eating robots.<br/>
    Once the game is complete, it cam be further developed by adding new fancy features.<br/>
    For this we need a solid base which we'll build together, refactor it bit by bit and once we have the basics, we could, for example, change game-logics a bit in order to provide sort of a multiplayer mode which, again, is the basic for a bot vs. bot mode.<br/>
    We'll start off very easy without any OOP, but using some old-school sequential code.<br/>
    We'll end up with pastafari-code and we'll learn how to design and layout a refactoring-target<br/>
    We'll do the refactoring and after that we will change the rules and see how our code get's along with that<br/>
    Finally we'll implement a multiplayer-mode by providing interfaces for ajax-requests so the php source transforms into a multiplayer-gameserver<br/>
    From there on, we will decide together what features we want to implement, for example we could add support for bot-players using the multiplayer-interfaces and build some player bots with minimal "AI" capabilities. Extremly difficult but extremly cool as well.<br/>
    Whenever questions arise, feel free to ask your colleagues or FK.

<h1>Rules of engagement</h1>
<div>
    <ul>
        <li>Since this is not work related, the times we spend with it are NOT worktimes. It's private practise and therefor times shall not be tracked in Jira.</li>
        <li>Participation is not mandatory. You can drop the ball whenever you want. Yet, as long as you are part of the trainees, there are mandatory meetings and there will be "homework" to do.</li>
        <li>The whole training-series will be mostly split up into small tasks, each doable within time < 60 Mins. It's the trainees duty to decide when he want's to work on this task, in the morning before work (of course you can work at your workplace), in the lunchbreak or after work.</li>
        <li>We'll have short meetups (10 minutes) every day at 09:50h where the trainer will give you a short description of the daily task. (I'll seriously try to have a new task ready every day, but since I'm developing all the stuff based on how far the class comes, this can be difficult, so please no blaming if we have short breaks here and there.)</li>
        <li>FK is available for questions every workday between 09:00-09:50</li>
        <li>Each friday we'll meet at 09:00 SHARP!(timeslot has to be discussed) and check together what solutions where found during the week, which lessons where learned and based on the findings, we make a rough plan for the upcoming week. Keep in mind: This is 100% timeboxed. We won't start until everyone is available, but we will stop at 10:00h anyway. Less time due to late colleagues, results in less time for discussions about findings and next steps.</li>
    </ul>
